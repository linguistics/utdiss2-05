**tl;dr:** use [github.com/linguistics/utexas-latex](https://github.com/linguistics/utexas-latex) instead.

## This repository has been _deprecated_

This repository previously held a copy of the `utdiss2-05` package as distributed by a now-defunct site hosted by the University of Texas at Austin's Office of Graduate Studies.
(The "Office of Graduate Studies" itself has [apparently](https://www.google.com/search?q=utexas.edu+"Office+of+Graduate+Studies") been deprecated, and replaced by the "Graduate School".)
The final available version of that site is archived at <https://web.archive.org/web/20150627045550/http://www.utexas.edu/ogs/etd/LaTeX/UT+Dissertation.packages/>.
According to that page, the distributed package was last "OFFICIAL" as of the 2001 requirements.

Considering that...

* as far as I know, there is no up-to-date Graduate School-maintained or official LaTeX package for University of Texas at Austin "electronic theses, reports dissertations and treatises",
* the only official typesetting help that UT provides consists of Microsoft Word templates,
* Microsoft Word sucks for writing long documents with references,
* the `utdiss2-05` package was an absolute mess,
* it had no explicit license,
* and it was more than a decade out of date,

...I have decided to go with a clean-room rewrite based on the current (as of writing, May 2016) "FORMAT GUIDELINES FOR DISSERTATIONS, TREASTISES, THESES AND REPORTS".

**The latest version of the rewrite can be found at [github.com/linguistics/utexas-latex](https://github.com/linguistics/utexas-latex).** All development will be continued in that repository.
